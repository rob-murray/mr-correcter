### Description

MrCorrecter is a friendly guy, he searches Twitter for spelling mistakes and replies to the tweets pointing out to the tweeters that they have misspelled a word.

[Mr_Correcter](https://twitter.com/Mr_Correcter)

#### Apology

First off, if **mr-correcter** has offended or annoyed anyone in particular I must apologise for him; he means no harm and is just trying to help the world's spelling.

#### mr-correcter

**mr-correcter** is mainly a development exercise, a little play thing; he is just a few lines of code to play around with the Twitter gem. This app searches Twitter using the Twitter API for spelling mistakes, these actually being a common misspelling of a particular word as opposed to any dictionary based testing. The code then creates a reply and again using the Twitter API will `reply_to` the Tweet with the correct spelling of the word.

It appears that not many people enjoy being corrected and reply back to **mr-correcter** and he receives a fair amount of abuse back from the mispellers, have a look at [some of the replies to him](http://robertomurray.co.uk/blog/2012/the-twitter-account-mr-correcter/).

2. Create and edit `config.yml` (see `config.example.yml` for details) or amend the configuration block in `Rakefile`. Alter parameters and add Twitter API credentials. Also edit corrections if necessary.
